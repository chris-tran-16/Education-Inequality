# Education-Inequality

Project for CS 594: Data Science for Networks at the University of Illinois at Chicago.

In this work we explore the 2013-2014 school year data to identify key features of schools that attribute to performance of schools. A writeup on the results can be found in the "Reports" folder. The work done on this project was done in multiple jupyter notebooks that can all be found in the "Code" folder. One required external file is the school universe information file found on the Common Core of Data website.

The required school universe information can be found at the Common Core of Data website:
